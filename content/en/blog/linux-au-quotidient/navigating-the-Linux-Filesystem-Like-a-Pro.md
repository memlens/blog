### **1. A Quick Recap (Just in Case!)**

Before we dive into the wild world of files and directories 🗂️, let's quickly recap what we've learned so far in [Introduction to the Linux Shell]({{< relref "introduction-to-the-linux-shell" >}}):

- **The Linux Kernel**: The brain 🧠 of your system.
- **GNU Tools**: The muscles 💪 that make the kernel usable.
- **The Shell**: Your command center 🎮 for all things Linux.

Got it? Great! Now, let’s move to the good stuff: **the filesystem**. It's like the **map** of your system 🗺️, and once you know how to navigate it, you’ll be able to find what you're looking for in a snap!

### **2. The Linux Filesystem Structure: What's Inside?**

Unlike Windows, where everything is usually stored under **C:\\**, Linux has a **single root directory** (`/`) yep, just one big ol' folder that houses everything. It’s like the **home base** of your system. 🏠

Here’s a **visual representation** of the Linux filesystem to help you see how everything is structured:

```bash
/
├── home
│   ├── yourname
│   │   ├── Documents
│   │   ├── Downloads
│   │   ├── Pictures
│   │   └── Music
├── bin
├── etc
├── usr
│   ├── bin
│   ├── lib
│   ├── share
├── var
└── tmp
```

Now let’s break it down further:

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/` | The root directory everything starts here. |
| `/home` | Personal files live here. Each user gets their own folder (e.g., `/home/yourname`). |
| `/bin` | Essential system commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `mkdir`. |
| `/usr/bin` | User-installed software and utilities. |
| `/etc` | System-wide configuration files (like Linux system settings). |
| `/var` | Stores logs, databases, and files that change frequently. |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files deleted automatically after reboot. |

**What’s the difference between `/bin` and `/usr/bin`?**
- `/bin` contains essential commands needed to boot and repair the system.
- `/usr/bin` holds additional utilities that are not critical for system booting but useful for users.

### **3. Basic Commands to Navigate the Filesystem**

Now that you know your way around the filesystem, let’s take a closer look at how to **navigate the system** based on **who you are**: Are you a **regular user** or the **root user**? 🧐

In Linux, there are **two types of users** that matter:

1. **The Regular User (`$`)**: This is you when you’re logged into your personal account.
2. **The Root User (`#`)**: This is the **administrator** of the system. The root user has **complete control** over the system, but this also comes with great responsibility (and risk). ⚠️

So how do you **tell the difference**? Simple! The **prompt** changes depending on your user:

- When you're logged in as a **regular user**, the prompt will look like this:
    ```bash
    $
    ```
- When you’re logged in as **root**, it will look like this:
    ```bash
    #
    ```

Always double-check that you’re logged in as a **regular user** for everyday tasks to avoid accidental system changes. 😱

### **4. Paths: The Address System of Linux**

Every file and directory in Linux has a **path** a unique address that tells you where it lives.

#### **🔹 Absolute Path (The Full Address)**
An **absolute path** starts from `/` (the root directory) and gives the complete address of a file or folder.

```bash
/home/yourname/Documents/myfile.txt
```
Think of it like the **GPS coordinates** of a file. 📌

#### **🔹 Relative Path (Shortcut to a Destination)**
A **relative path** is based on your **current location** in the filesystem. Instead of writing the full address, you reference files based on where you are.

```bash
./myfile.txt   # Refers to myfile.txt in the current directory
../myfile.txt  # Refers to myfile.txt in the parent directory
```
Relative paths save time when working in the terminal! ⏳

### **5. Searching Files Efficiently**

Want to find all `.txt` files in your directory? Wildcards and `find` to the rescue! 🎨

#### **🔹 Wildcards**
- **`*`**: Matches any number of characters.
    ```bash
    $ ls *.txt
    notes.txt  report.txt  schedule.txt
    ```
- **`?`**: Matches a single character.
    ```bash
    $ ls file?.txt
    file1.txt  file2.txt  fileA.txt
    ```

#### **🔹 `find`: The Ultimate Search Tool**
- Find a file by name:
    ```bash
    $ find /home -name "*.txt"
    ```
- Find files larger than 100MB:
    ```bash
    $ find /home -size +100M  
    ```
- Find files modified in the last 7 days:
    ```bash
    $ find /var/log -mtime -7  
    ```

The `find` command helps you locate **anything, anywhere** in your filesystem. 🔍

### **6. Next Steps: Becoming a Filesystem Pro**

Congrats! You’re now equipped with the tools to **navigate** the Linux filesystem like a true pro. But don’t stop here! The filesystem is your playground, and there’s a lot more to explore.

Now that you can navigate like a boss, let’s level up by learning how to **manipulate files** copying, moving, and even renaming them like a Linux ninja! 🥷
