### **Introduction** 🌱  

My first encounter with Linux happened during my first year studying **computer science** at the IUT of Parakou. It was the second semester when I noticed a classmate with an incredible desktop setup on his PC. Curious, I approached him, and he told me he was using **Kali Linux**, an operating system mainly used for hacking.  

That was the first time I saw something other than **Windows**. Back in 2023, **Windows 10 was the standard**, and I used it without giving it much thought. But after this discovery, my curiosity was piqued—I needed to explore this new world.  

I started watching tutorials, installed **VirtualBox**, and launched my first Kali Linux VM. The command line immediately fascinated me. Everything felt **more powerful, flexible, and direct**. I was so intrigued that I avoided using the GNOME graphical interface, preferring to do everything in the CLI. At that moment, I **felt like a real hacker**.  

But there was a problem: **the transition was slow**. My main system was still Windows, which I used for **coding, testing software, and studying**. I was spending more time on it than I wanted to.  

Then, one day, while working on a **C project**, I ran into a frustrating issue: to type `<` and `>`, which are essential for **#include directives**, I had to **either use the on-screen keyboard** or memorize annoying key combinations (`Alt+60` and `Alt+62`). Fed up, I searched for solutions and found a tutorial from a developer who was using Linux.  

Out of curiosity, I switched to Linux and started testing different key combinations. That’s when I discovered **Shift + Alt + W for `<` and Shift + Alt + X for `>`**. That was my **breaking point**—I decided I would never use Windows for coding again.  

From that moment on, I fully embraced Linux, learning the command line through tutorials and courses like OpenClassrooms. I experimented with **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, then **dual boot**, until I finally decided to **go full Linux** and never look back.

### **Why Leave Windows/macOS?** ❌  

💥 **Lack of control** – Windows and macOS impose frustrating limitations, from forced updates to proprietary software and data collection. I never felt like I truly **owned** my system.  

💥 **Performance and stability** – Windows slows down over time due to background processes and bloatware. Linux, on the other hand, is lightweight, optimized, and doesn’t need high-end hardware to run smoothly.  

💥 **Customization** – With Linux, **everything is modifiable**. From window managers to package managers, I could craft a system that fits **my workflow perfectly**.  

💥 **Security and privacy** – Linux is inherently more secure, and I have **full control over what runs on my machine**.

### **What Linux Means to Me Today** 🚀  

✅ **Freedom** – No more restrictions; I can do whatever I want with my OS.  
✅ **Customization** – My system is **fully tailored** to my needs.  
✅ **Performance** – Fast, lightweight, and efficient, even on older hardware.  
✅ **Open Source Philosophy** – Being part of a transparent, collaborative ecosystem.

### **My Journey to Linux** 🛤️  

#### **My Chaotic Beginnings** 💥  
My Linux journey was **a series of experiments, failures, and discoveries**. I tested several distributions:  

- **Kali Linux** → My first Linux experience, but not ideal for daily use.  
- **Kali WSL & Ubuntu WSL** → First steps into a Linux-like environment inside Windows.  
- **Ubuntu & MX Linux** → My first real installations on a physical machine.  
- **Linux Mint** → A smooth and user-friendly experience, but not customizable enough for me.  
- **Arch Linux** → I loved having full control, but the installation was a challenge.  
- **Void Linux** → My final choice for its **simplicity, speed, and unique package management (XBPS)**.  

At first, I **didn’t understand anything**. I installed software randomly, broke my system multiple times, and my only solution was to **reinstall everything from scratch**. But that’s how I learned.

### **Major Discoveries** 💡  

🔹 **Tiling Window Managers** (i3, bspwm) → A game-changer for productivity.  
🔹 **Package management** → Pacman (Arch), APT (Debian/Ubuntu), XBPS (Void).  
🔹 **Dotfiles & Minimalist Configurations** → Mastering my environment from A to Z.

### **Why I Chose Void Linux** 🏆  

💨 **Rolling release** – Always up-to-date, without being tied to fixed versions.  
⚡ **Speed & lightweight** – One of the fastest and most responsive distros I’ve used.  
🛠 **XBPS (package manager)** – Simple, efficient, and fast.  
🚀 **No systemd** – More control over the init system, keeping things minimal.

### **Why Choose Linux in 2025?** 📅  

- 🛠 **Full control over your system**  
- ⚡ **Performance & efficiency** (no planned obsolescence)  
- 🔐 **Security & privacy**  
- 🌍 **Rich open-source ecosystem & active community**

### **My Advice for Getting Started with Linux** 🎯  

1️⃣ **Choose the right distro** – Ubuntu/Mint for beginners, Arch/Void for tinkerers.  
2️⃣ **Learn terminal basics** – Essential commands (`cd`, `ls`, `mv`, `grep`, etc.).  
3️⃣ **Don’t be afraid to break things** – You learn by experimenting!  
4️⃣ **Join a community** – Discord, Reddit, Linux forums.  
5️⃣ **Optimize your workflow** – Neovim, Tmux, Fish/Zsh, scripts, and dotfiles.

### **Conclusion** 💡  

Linux is **not just an OS—it’s a philosophy, a journey, and a continuous learning experience**. I started out of curiosity, but I stayed out of passion.  

If you’re interested in exploring this world, I’ll be sharing **tutorials, configurations, and tips** to help you get started.  

🔥 **Stay tuned, and hack the system!** 🔥
